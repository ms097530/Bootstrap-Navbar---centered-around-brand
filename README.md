# Bootstrap-Navbar---centered-around-brand
An example of a bootstrap navbar with a centered 'brand' and surrounding links. This was created only using Bootstrap classes.

Display property is toggled depending on screen size on what should currently be displaying the .navbar-brand item. The setup within the <ul> is what is display on large displays and up. For smaller displays, the 'brand' in the <ul> is hidden and the remaining items are displayed via the hamburger toggler. The 'brand' outside of the .collapse div is displayed and not centered (defaults to left).
